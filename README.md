# Avail Telepathy Operator
The operator from [`SP1 Telepathy`](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1-telepathy) (`script/bin/operator.rs`) adapted for operating Avail.

The previous operator reads and writes to an Ethereum contract. This repo is a reference to build off of, with the end goal of reading and writing to Avail instead.

For more context, please see https://github.com/availproject/avail/pull/630

## Run operator
The code compiles and should run given the placeholder functions and values are filled in. They are marked by comments beginning with `// TODO - AVAIL:`
1. `cd ./script`
2. `cargo run`
