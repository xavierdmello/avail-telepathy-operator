# Avail Telepathy Operator
The operator from `script/bin/operator.rs` in [`SP1 Telepathy`](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1-telepathy) adapted for operating avail with native on-node Ethereum state verification logic.

The previous operator reads and writes to an Ethereum contract. This repo is a reference to build off of, with the end goal of reading and writing to Avail instead.
